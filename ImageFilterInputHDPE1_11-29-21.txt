% This is the input file for the image filtering algorithm
% Any text after a % is ignored (used to be # but some file names has that included)
% The input file is ordered specifically so if you change the order or add/remove a field
% ...you need to then change the python script accordingly
% first item is the path to the input images
C:/Users/mattg_000/Documents/Research/ImageFilterCode/OSUphantomHDPE1_11-29-21/
HDPE1_Projection % base file name without the number
Float % numbering system for images can be Integer (0,1,2...), Float (0.0,1.0,2.0...) TripleInteger (000,001,002...)
MedianDifference/ %path to median difference images relative to input path. Put None if need to create these
HDPE1_Projection_MedDiff % base name of the median difference image. Put None if we need to create these
Float % numbering system for median difference image
HDPE1_11-29-21_SwitchMedFiltered_UsingNeighbors/ %output file path relative to input path
HDPE1_11-29-21_Filtered_ %OutputBaseName
HDPE1_FlaggedNoise_	%Flag map name
359 % maximum degree reached
0 % starting degree (usually 0 or 1)
1 % increment between each (in case of integer type needs to be 1 or some int)
NoDup % Are there multiple images at each angle? YesDup for yes NoDup for no
% Do you want the filter to use neighboring radiographs to fill gray val?
YesNeighbors % YesNeighbors for yes or NoNeighbors for no
NoFlag % YesFlag means we need to track the noise. NoFlag means we don't need to do the track noise step as we already have them
2 % number of open beam images to consider
OpenBeam %open beam image name
50	%Percent of open beam standard deviation that identifies noise (typically 50% for fast neutrons and 150% for thermal) 
25	%percent of open beam standard deviation that identifies bloomed noise (25% fast, 50% thermal)
